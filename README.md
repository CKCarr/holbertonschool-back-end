<details>
<summary>What Bash scripting should not be used for?</summary>
<br>
Bash scripting should not be used for complex applications that require extensive data processing or heavy computational tasks. While Bash is powerful for automating tasks, it is primarily designed for shell scripting and lacks the advanced features and performance of programming languages like Python or C++.

<summary>What is a REST API?</summary>
<br>
A REST API (Representational State Transfer API) is a type of API that follows the principles of the REST architectural style. It is based on a client-server communication model and uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact with resources. REST APIs typically use JSON (or sometimes XML) as the data format for representing and transferring data.

<summary>What are microservices?</summary>
<br>
Microservices are an architectural approach to building software applications as a collection of small, loosely coupled services. Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Microservices promote modularity, flexibility, and the ability to develop and maintain complex applications more effectively.

<summary>What is the CSV format?</summary>
<br>
CSV (Comma-Separated Values) is a plain text file format commonly used for storing tabular data. Each line in a CSV file represents a row, and the values within each row are separated by commas. CSV files are widely supported and can be opened and manipulated using spreadsheet software or programming languages.

<summary>What is the JSON format?</summary>
<br>
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format. It is often used for representing structured data in a human-readable and machine-readable format. JSON data consists of key-value pairs and supports nested structures, arrays, numbers, booleans, and null values. It has become a popular format for data exchange between web services and is widely supported in various programming languages.
